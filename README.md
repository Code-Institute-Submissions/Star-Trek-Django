## Project Background

Welcome to my Full Stack Frameworks with Django Project for Code Institute. 

The goal of this project was to allow the user to create an account and make a purchase of product/membership with Stripe. Database used is a SQL database PostgresSQL.

I am a big Star Trek fan so for my last project with Code Institute, I decided to make a Star Trek web-site, where beside creating account and purchasing a product via Stripe, 
user can also read news from Star Trek franchise, find games about Star Trek and join discussions about Star Trek in a discussion forum. Users can also chat via private
messaging system and edit their profiles so beside this project being a web-shop, it is also a form of social network for people who like Star Trek.
